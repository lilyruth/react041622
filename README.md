# This my react version of the same take-home project I completed earlier today 

(see https://github.com/lilyruth/takeHome041622/blob/main/README.md)

I had some fun with changing up colors. 

The site is still mobile friendly.

The components are organized into a stateless Content component and two API Call components. The first API call passes two props to the second API call. When the second API call is triggered, the second API Call component is then displayed. A button resets the display.
